Portfolio Landing Page

Introduction

Hello everyone!

This is a portfolio landing page that I have created to showcase my work. It is composed of several components, including "About," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact." The components are reusable, allowing for easy customization and further development.

Technologies Used

JavaScript
React
CSS
HTML
Note

I want to emphasize that I am relatively new to programming and still in the early stages of my coding journey. As a result, there may be errors and areas where I could have implemented things more efficiently. I am constantly learning and growing, and I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Responsiveness

I acknowledge that the current version of the page is not fully responsive. However, I have attached a screenshot to demonstrate how it appears on my MacBook.
