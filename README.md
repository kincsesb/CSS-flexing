##Portfolio Landing Page

##Introduction

Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio landing page.

This is a portfolio landing page that I have created to showcase my work. It is composed of several components, including "About," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact." These components can be reused in other projects to save development time. However, please note that the images used in this portfolio are not available for reuse.

I have utilized JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML to build this portfolio landing page. It's important to mention that I am relatively new to programming and still in the early stages of my coding journey. As a result, there may be mistakes and areas where I could have implemented things more elegantly. I am continuously learning and growing, and I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

##Responsiveness

While I acknowledge that the current version of the page is not responsive, I have attached a screenshot to show how it appears on my MacBook.
